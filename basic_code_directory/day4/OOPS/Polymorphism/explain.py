'''🔁 Polymorphism vs. Overriding
Feature	Polymorphism	Method Overriding
Definition	A concept: same method behaves differently depending on the object	A specific action: subclass provides its own version of a method from the parent class
What is it?	A behavior (a result of overriding or duck typing)	A technique (you implement it directly)
Requires Inheritance?	❌ Not always (Python supports duck typing)	✅ Yes, always
Goal	To write flexible and reusable code	To change or extend parent behavior
Example	Calling .speak() on different objects with different results	Defining a new .speak() in a subclass to override parent’s version
Used in	Function calls, collections of mixed object types	Inside subclasses that inherit from a parent class

🎯 Polymorphism (Example)

def make_it_speak(obj):
    print(obj.speak())
You pass different objects (Dog, Cat, Robot) to this function.

As long as they have a speak() method, it works.

That’s polymorphism — same method name, different behavior.

🔄 Method Overriding (Example)

class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "generic animal sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):  # Overriding parent method
        return "woof"
The Dog class overrides the speak() method of Animal.

Now when Dog().speak() is called, it returns "woof", not the parent version.

This is overriding, and it enables polymorphism when used with other subclasses.

✅ Final Analogy:
🔧 Overriding is the tool
🔁 Polymorphism is the effect that happens
when you use the tool across different classes.'''
