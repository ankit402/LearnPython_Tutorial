Explanation of the Car and Tesla Classes with Inheritance
ðŸ§± Class Hierarchy & Inheritance
This example demonstrates inheritance in Pythonâ€™s object-oriented programming (OOP):

Base class: Car â€” provides a common structure and interface.

Derived class: Tesla â€” inherits from Car and extends functionality.

ðŸ”¹ Base Class: Car
python
Copy
Edit
class Car:
    def __init__(self, type):
        self.type = type  # Store engine type, e.g., "electric" or "petrol"

    def EngineType(self):
        pass  # Placeholder method to be overridden by subclasses
The constructor __init__ initializes the attribute type.

EngineType() is a placeholder method (does nothing) meant to be overridden by subclasses.

ðŸ”¹ Derived Class: Tesla
python
Copy
Edit
class Tesla(Car):
    def __init__(self, type, isdrivingauto):
        super().__init__(type)  # Initialize inherited attribute from Car
        self.isdrivingauto = isdrivingauto  # New attribute for autopilot status

    def is_driving(self):
        print(f"Tesla is {'driving automatically' if self.isdrivingauto else 'being driven manually'}.")

    def EngineType(self):
        if self.type.lower() == "electric":
            print("Tesla engine type is electric.")
        else:
            print("Tesla engine type is petrol.")
Inheritance: Tesla extends Car, inheriting its attributes and methods.

The constructor calls super().__init__(type) to reuse Car's initialization.

Adds a new boolean attribute isdrivingauto indicating autopilot status.

Implements is_driving(), which prints if the car is in autopilot or manual mode.

Overrides EngineType() to provide actual behavior based on the engine type:

Prints "Tesla engine type is electric." if type is "electric".

Otherwise, defaults to "Tesla engine type is petrol."

ðŸ”¸ Object Creation & Method Calls
python
Copy
Edit
c1 = Tesla("electric", True)
c1.EngineType()   # Output: Tesla engine type is electric.
c1.is_driving()   # Output: Tesla is driving automatically.
Creates a Tesla object c1 with:

type = "electric"

isdrivingauto = True (autopilot enabled)

Calls overridden EngineType() method to print engine info.

Calls is_driving() to print driving mode based on autopilot status.

âœ… Summary Table
Concept	Explanation
Inheritance	Tesla inherits from Car
Constructor	Initializes attributes type and isdrivingauto
Method Override	Tesla overrides the placeholder EngineType() from Car
Conditional Logic	Prints messages based on the engine type and driving mode
Object Creation	Creates Tesla object and uses its methods
