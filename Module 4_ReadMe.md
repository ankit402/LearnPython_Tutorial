📘 Module 4: Advanced Functions Assignments
✅ Lesson 4.1: Defining Functions
🔢 Assignment 1: Fibonacci Sequence with Memoization
Define a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using memoization.
✅ Test the function with different inputs.

🧱 Assignment 2: Function with Nested Default Arguments
Define a function that takes two arguments, a and b, where b is a dictionary with a default value of an empty dictionary {}.
The function should add a new key-value pair to the dictionary and return it.
✅ Test the function with different inputs.

🔑 Assignment 3: Function with Variable Keyword Arguments
Define a function that takes a variable number of keyword arguments and returns a dictionary containing only those key-value pairs where the value is an integer.
✅ Test with different inputs.

🔁 Assignment 4: Function with Callback
Define a function that takes another function as a callback and a list of integers.
The function should apply the callback to each integer in the list and return a new list with the results.
✅ Test with different callback functions.

🔄 Assignment 5: Function that Returns a Function
Define a function that returns another function.
The returned function should take an integer and return its square.
✅ Test the returned function with different inputs.

⏱️ Assignment 6: Function with Decorators
Define a function that calculates the time taken to execute another function.
Apply this decorator to a function that performs a complex calculation.
✅ Test the decorated function with different inputs.

🔍 Assignment 7: Higher-Order Function for Filtering and Mapping
Define a higher-order function that takes two functions:

a filter function

a map function
along with a list of integers.
The higher-order function should first filter the integers and then map the filtered values.
✅ Test with different functions.

🔗 Assignment 8: Function Composition
Define a function that composes two functions f and g, such that the result is f(g(x)).
✅ Test with different f and g.

🧩 Assignment 9: Partial Function Application
Use the functools.partial function to create a new function that multiplies its input by 2.
✅ Test with different inputs.

⚠️ Assignment 10: Function with Error Handling
Define a function that takes a list of integers and returns their average.
The function should handle errors (e.g., empty list) and return None in such cases.
✅ Test with different inputs.

♾️ Assignment 11: Function with Generators
Define a function that generates an infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers.
✅ Test by printing the first 10 numbers in the sequence.

🧮 Assignment 12: Currying
Define a curried function that takes three arguments one at a time and returns their product.
✅ Test by providing arguments one at a time.

📄 Assignment 13: Function with Context Manager
Define a function that uses a context manager to write a list of integers to a file.
The function should handle file operation errors.
✅ Test with different lists.

🔄 Assignment 14: Function with Multiple Return Types
Define a function that takes a list of mixed data types (integers, strings, and floats) and returns three separate lists:

one with all the integers

one with all the strings

one with all the floats
✅ Test with different inputs.

🧠 Assignment 15: Function with State
Define a function that maintains state between calls using a mutable default argument.
The function should keep track of how many times it has been called.
✅ Test by calling the function multiple times.
